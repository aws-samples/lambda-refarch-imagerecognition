## Step 2: Add branching logic to state machine

The first step of state machine gives us more information about the image file, which can be used to determine what set of further actions the workflow needs to take, e.g. if the file supplied is a format not supported by our image recognition service, send it to another Lambda function that performs type conversion or simply send an error notification to the customer and terminate the workflow.

There are two mechanisms in AWS Step Functions that enables branching: [Choice State](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/awl-ref-states-choice.html)  and [Error Try/Catches](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/awl-ref-errors.html). Choice State allows choosing the next state based on if/else or case/switch conditions (supports a combination of And Or Not and = > < operators ) on the input data. Error Try/Catches allows choosing the next state depending on the type of error thrown by the current execution.

In this step, we will add input validation to the state machine by leveraging both Error Try/Catches and Choice State. By the end of this step the state machine will look like this:

### Step 2A: Add branching to State Machine definition

Consider in our scenario we only support JPEG and PNG formats. The image analysis Lambda function can detect image formats, so we can use a Choice State after the first step to evaluate the output from the metadata extraction and make branching decisions. For other file types the image processing library does not even have an analyzer for, an exception is thrown from the Lambda function. So here we can combine using Choice State and Error Try/Catch. 

1. Go back to the text editor that you had the state machine definition. It should look like this:
	
	```JSON
	{
	  "StartAt": "ExtractImageMetadata",
	  "Comment": "Imgage Processing State Machine",
	  "States": {
	    "ExtractImageMetadata": {
	      "Type": "Task",
	      "Resource": "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_LAMBDA_ARN",
          "ResultPath": "$.extractedMetadata",
	      "End": true
	    }
	  }
	}
	```

1. The next step we are going to add to our state machine is the fail state, **NotSupportedImageType**. This step will terminate and mark failure for executions that cannot proceed because the image type is not supported.
	
	Add a **Fail** state following the **ExtractImageMetadata** state in the state machine definition:

	```JSON
		,
	    "NotSupportedImageType": {
	      "Type": "Fail",
	      "Cause": "Image type not supported!",
	      "Error": "FileTypeNotSupported"
	    },
	```

1. Next, we add an error try/catch to the **ExtractImageMetadata** step pointing to the fail state. The lambda function is written so that when it encounters a file type (e.g. txt) that it can't parse as an image, it will throw an error of type `ImageIdentifyError`. Using the Error try/catch functionality of Step Functions, we can configure the state machine to transition to **NotSupportedImageType** Fail state when this error happens. 

	Add a **Catch** block to the **ExtractImageMetadata** step:
	
	<pre>
	    "ExtractImageMetadata": {
	      "Type": "Task",
	      "Resource": "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_LAMBDA_ARN",<b>
	      "Catch": [{
	        "ErrorEquals": [
	          "ImageIdentifyError"
	        ],
	        "ResultPath": "$.error",
	        "Next": "NotSupportedImageType"
	      }],</b>
	      "ResultPath": "$.extractedMetadata",
	       "End": true
	    }
	</pre>

	> See this [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/automating-aws-lambda-function-error-handling-with-aws-step-functions/) on how to define custom error codes in Lambda functions in different languages. 
	 
1. To ensure only JPEG and PNG images are allowed to be further processed, we create a Choice state that directs to the *NotSupportedImageType* Fail state when the image format is not JPEG or PNG. 

	Add a **Choice** state after the **NotSupportedImageType** fail state (Note that after adding this block there will be a syntax error on one of the lines due to a missing state. This will get resolved after completing the next step): 

	```JSON
	  "ImageTypeCheck": {
	      "Type": "Choice",
	      "Choices": [{
	        "Or": [{
	            "Variable": "$.extractedMetadata.format",
	            "StringEquals": "JPEG"
	          },
	          {
	            "Variable": "$.extractedMetadata.format",
	            "StringEquals": "PNG"
	          }
	        ],
	        "Next": "Parallel"
	      }],
	      "Default": "NotSupportedImageType"
	  },
	```
	
	Also, because the **Choice** state should follow the **ExtractImageMetadata** state, update the first state and replace the `"End": true` with a pointer to the choice state as next step: `"Next": "ImageTypeCheck"`:

	<pre>
		"ExtractImageMetadata":{  
		   "Type":"Task",
		   "Resource":"REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_LAMBDA_ARN",
		   "Catch":[  
		      {  
		         "ErrorEquals":[  
		            "ImageIdentifyError"
		         ],
		         "ResultPath":"$.error",
		         "Next":"NotSupportedImageType"
		      }
		   ],
		   "ResultPath":"$.extractedMetadata",
		   <b>"Next":"ImageTypeCheck"</b>
		}
	</pre>
				

	
	
1. The Choice state must not be an end state in a Step Functions state machine. Therefore, we need to have a state following the choice state. For now, create a placeholder **Pass** state that will be replaced by a parallel processing step (Note we already have a `Next` pointer to this state from the **ImageTypeCheck** state): 
	
	```JSON
	    "Parallel": {
	      "Type": "Pass",
	      "Result": {
	        "message": "This is a placeholder we will replace it with a Parallel state soon"
	      },
	      "End": true
	    }
    ```
	
1. Check your JSON is properly formatted by leveraging a JSON validator and formatter like [this one](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/)


### Step 2B: Update the AWS Step Functions state machine

1. Go to [AWS Step Functions management console](http://console.aws.amazon.com/states/home). Make sure the AWS Region selection matches the one you have been working with so far.

1. Select the `ImageProcessing` state machine. Click on **Edit state machine**

1. Scroll down and paste in the JSON generated from Step 2A

1. You can click on the &#x21ba; icon next to **Visual Workflow** to refresh the visual representation of the state machine:

	<img src="images/2b-step-console-update-preview.png" width="90%">

1. Click **Update and start execution**
	

### Step 2C: Test the state machine execution

1. Test this new state machine with the same input you did in **Step 1C**

	```JSON
	{
	  "s3Bucket": "FILL_IN_YOUR_VALUE",
	  "s3Key": "tests/1_cactus.jpg"
	}
	```

	You will see that the execution succeededs and the workflow shows this output:
	
	```JSON
	{
	  "output": "This is a placeholder we will replace it with a Task state soon"
	}
	```
	Also, you will see that the workflow has passed through all the steps till the end:
	
	<img src="images/2c-test-choice-test-succeeded.png" width="50%">

1. Now, let's try it with a different input (*.tiff* image type):

	```JSON
	{
	  "s3Bucket": "FILL_IN_YOUR_VALUE",
	  "s3Key": "tests/2_lake_snow.tiff"
	}
	```
	We used an unsupported image type! Here is the output we see:
	
	```JSON
	{
	  "error": "FileTypeNotSupported",
	  "cause": "Image type not supported!"
	}
	```
	Hence, the workflow of the execution confirms our mistake:
	
	<img src="images/2c-test-choice-test-failed.png" width="50%">

1. Test it with a txt file that we have wrongly appended with .jpg suffix:

	```JSON
	{
	  "s3Bucket": "FILL_IN_YOUR_VALUE",
	  "s3Key": "tests/3_txt_prentending_jpg.jpg"
	}
	```
	
	We expect the *ExtractImageMetadata* lambda function to throw an `ImageIdentifyError`, which will direct the flow to the fail state, without even hitting the **Choice** state

                     "StringEquals":"JPEG"
                  },
                  {  
                     "Variable":"$.extractedMetadata.format",
                     "StringEquals":"PNG"
                  }
               ],
               "Next":"Parallel"
            }
         ],
         "Default":"NotSupportedImageType"
      },
      "Parallel":{  
         "Type":"Pass",
         "Result":{  
            "message":"This is a placeholder we will replace it with a Parallel state soon"
         },
         "End":true
      }
   }
}
```
</details>

If problems persist, you can always use that final JSON to create a working state machine. Just make sure to update the AWS Region and AWS Account ID in the Lambda function ARN to reflect your setup.
